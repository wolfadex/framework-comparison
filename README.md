# framework-comparison

A minimal framework comparison. I'll attempt to implement a basic Todo App that uses localStorage as well as a Quiz App using https://opentdb.com/ and localStorage for high scores.

## Frameworks / Languages:

- [Imba](https://www.imba.io/)
  - [x] [todo](./imba)
  - [ ] quiz
- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) + [Karax](https://github.com/pragmagic/karax)
  - [ ] todo
  - [ ] quiz
